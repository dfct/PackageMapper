PackageMapper
======

Map Windows Operating Systems from top-level packages to bottom-level components.

This is an old project of mine written while exploring the relationship of packages in \Windows\servicing\Packages and components in \Windows\WinSxS. Very ugly code, but perhaps of interest to someone.
